1. Salaries Differences 

WITH max_dep AS
    (SELECT department, max(salary) max_sal
    FROM db_employee de
    JOIN db_dept dd ON de.department_id = dd.id
    GROUP BY department)
    
SELECT 
    ABS((SELECT max_sal from max_dep WHERE department = 'marketing')
        - (SELECT max_sal from max_dep WHERE department = 'engineering'))

-- different approach
SELECT 
    ABS(MAX(CASE WHEN department = 'marketing' THEN salary ELSE NULL END)
    - MAX(CASE WHEN department = 'engineering' THEN salary ELSE NULL END)) AS DIFF
FROM db_employee de
JOIN db_dept dd ON de.department_id = dd.id

2. Employees Current Salary
SELECT 
    id, first_name, last_name, department_id, MAX(salary) current_salary
FROM ms_employee_salary
GROUP BY id
ORDER BY id
